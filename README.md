**Text encryption using Caeser Cipher**
**Caesar Cipher**: Simple Python implementation for basic text encryption using the classical Caesar cipher method. Shifts each letter by a fixed amount for obfuscation. Limited security; designed for educational purposes.
A simple code in python to decrypt and encrypt.


**Encryption**: This is the process of converting plain text or data into an encoded version, known as ciphertext, using an algorithm and a key.
Encryption is used to protect sensitive information during transmission or storage, such as passwords, credit card numbers, or personal messages.

**Decryption**: This is the process of converting encrypted data back into its original, readable form using the corresponding decryption key or algorithm.


Encryption is vital for securing digital communication, transactions, and data. Messaging apps like WhatsApp use encryption for message confidentiality, while online banking and e-commerce platforms encrypt financial
transactions and personal data. Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) ensure privacy in remote work, and collaboration tools encrypt files to prevent unauthorized access. 
Healthcare organizations use encryption to safeguard patient records, and password managers employ encryption for secure storage of login credentials. 
Smartphones and devices integrate encryption to protect stored data, while social media platforms use encryption to secure private messages and personal information.
Overall, encryption ensures confidentiality, integrity, and privacy across various domains, enhancing cybersecurity and mitigating the risk of data breaches.
